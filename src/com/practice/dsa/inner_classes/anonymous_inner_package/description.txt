Anonymous Inner Classes
Detailed Description
An anonymous inner class is a class without a name that is declared and instantiated all at once, typically as an
argument to a method or as an implementation of an interface or abstract class. They are used to override methods of
classes or interfaces.

Characteristics
No Name: Anonymous inner classes do not have a class name.
Single Use: They are often used for one-time use, usually to provide a simple implementation of an interface or to
    override the methods of a class.
Instantiation and Declaration: They are declared and instantiated simultaneously.
Can Extend a Class or Implement an Interface: You can create an anonymous inner class to extend an existing class or to
    implement an interface.
