Overview:
The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it. It is used to add an additional layer of security, control, or functionality when accessing an object.

Intent:

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Control access to the original object, adding a layer of functionality without changing the original object's code.
Key Concepts:

Subject Interface: Declares common operations for both the real object and the proxy.
Real Subject: The actual object that the proxy represents.
Proxy: Controls access to the real object and may add additional functionality.
