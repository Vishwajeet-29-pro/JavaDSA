# Road Map By Shivam
##### very easy level of problems
- design concepts
- code practices
- clean code
##### Java has some trending things in market:
- [ ] solid principals
- [ ] KISS
- [ ] tdd
- [ ] real world problems with solid principals
- [ ] modular level
##### Topic wise
- [ ] java 8 + lambda
- [ ] functional style (stream map filter)
- [ ] Generics
- [ ] wrapper classes
- [ ] Optional,
- [ ] all oops
- [ ] JVM level
    - [ ] how jvm works
    - [ ] how we can optimize it
    - [ ] how garbage collector works,
    - [ ] writing code at such level so that performance is at peak level.

##### Frameworks:
1. spring /spring boot
    1. configurations
    2. annotations
    3. how to define bean
    4. spring data jpa

##### Problem solving side: very basics of problems.
##### what are different cloud services
- [ ] what is aws provides,
- [ ] what is jenkins
